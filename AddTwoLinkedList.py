# Just like how you would sum two numbers on a piece of paper, we begin by summing the least-significant digits, which is the head of l1l1 and l2l2. Since each digit is in the range of 0 \ldots 90â€¦9, summing two digits may "overflow". For example 5 + 7 = 125+7=12. In this case, we set the current digit to 22 and bring over the carry = 1carry=1 to the next iteration. carrycarry must be either 00 or 11 because the largest possible sum of two digits (including the carry) is 9 + 9 + 1 = 199+9+1=19.

# The pseudocode is as following:

# Initialize current node to dummy head of the returning list.
# Initialize carry to 00.
# Initialize pp and qq to head of l1l1 and l2l2 respectively.
# Loop through lists l1l1 and l2l2 until you reach both ends.
# Set xx to node pp's value. If pp has reached the end of l1l1, set to 00.
# Set yy to node qq's value. If qq has reached the end of l2l2, set to 00.
# Set sum = x + y + carrysum=x+y+carry.
# Update carry = sum / 10carry=sum/10.
# Create a new node with the digit value of (sum \bmod 10)(summod10) and set it to current node's next, then advance current node to next.
# Advance both pp and qq.
